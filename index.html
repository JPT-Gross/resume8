        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a STEM teacher at J.P. Taravella High School. I teach game
            design/programming. I am also a lifelong tinkerer, maker and
            learner. I love putting new things into the world, whether that is
            through woodworking, art, or coding. Passing on a maker mindset is
            at the core of my teaching philosophy.
